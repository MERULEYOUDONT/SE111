            <h2>REVIEW</h2>

            <p><b>Jakob Caramiciu</b></p>

            <p><i>2/6/2021</i></p>

            <p>Although I have not watched this cinematography masterpiece in quite some time, however this movie was
                one of many movies that I enjoyed watching thoroughly in my childhood. The seemingly bizarre and absurd
                plot of the movie made for many laughs.</p>

            <p>There was also a video game made from this game that I used to play on my PS3 with my dad. The game as
                well as the movie bring back vivid memories to better times, as we currently face a pandemic causing
                much emotional stress on a global scale. The game itself wasn't amazing, but it was the memories made
                with my father and remembering good times that make this movie forever stick with me in my thoughts.</p>

            <p>Also, you have to love the ending, Flint uses his spray on shoes invention that he was mocked for at the
                beginning of the movie, in order to destroy the machine causing it to rain food down onto the town. He
                really showed those kids that although the invention may not have worked as intended, it still had some
                sort of purpose in the world. A <i>very</i> important purpose, as it saved the town from what could have
                been its demise.</p>

                <h3>Trivia</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>In Israel, the film's title is "It's Raining Falafel". In Turkey, the title is "It's Raining
                        Kofta".
                    </li>
                    <li>(At around twenty-four minutes) When Flint is explaining how the machine can turn water into any
                        kind of food, Sam asks if Jell-O is possible. Flint says yes, and then asks if she likes peanut
                        butter. Sam says she is extremely allergic to peanuts, which prompts Flint to say, "Oh yeah, me
                        too!" In real life, Bill Hader is highly allergic to peanuts.
                    </li>
                    <li>(At around one hour and seven minutes) Flint's e-mail address is flockwood@flinternet.com. At
                        the time of the movie's release, going to Flinternet.com would redirect you to the movie's
                        official website.
                    </li>
