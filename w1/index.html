    <h1>Jakob Caramiciu</h1>
    <p>As you can tell by the header <b>above</b> my name is Jakob Caramiciu. I am from <i>Coventry, Rhode Island</i>. I
        am 18 years old and am one of <u>seven</u> children, with me being the oldest. Being the role model can
        sometimes be hard, but I am definitely off to a good start by going to college and furthering my education at
        New England Tech, a school that so far, I am really enjoying attending!</p>
